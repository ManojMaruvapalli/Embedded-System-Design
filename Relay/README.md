# Realy
 Using Relays for Embedded Systems Design  
 > Note : We are using STM32F401 ARM board  

 ## Automatic_Bulp_LDR_Relay_STM  
 Using Relay and LDR to detect is the surrounding is bright or dark and turn the light on or off automatically.  

 ## Bulp_Intensity_Relay_STM  
 Controlling the intensity of light emmited form bulp using relays by changing its duty cycle.  

 ## Relay_Switch_STM
 Controlling a Relay switch.
