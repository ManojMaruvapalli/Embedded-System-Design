# Sensors  
 Using Various Sensor for Embedded Systems Design  
 > Note : We are using STM32F401 ARM board  
 > Sensors Used : LDR-Light Detection, LM35 - Temperature Sensor, Mic  

 ## LDR_Obj_Cnt_STM  
 Using a LDR sensor to count number objects by detecting the change in the intensity of light and displaying it on a 7 segment display.  

 ## LDR_STM  
 Using a LDR to detect the intensity of light.  

 ## LM35_STM  
 Using a Temperature sensor*(LM35) to find the ambient temperature.

 ## Mic_Clap_Cnt_STM  
 Using a Mic to detect a clap sound and show the count on a 7 segment display.  

 ## Mic_Sound_Detect_stm  
 Using a Mic to detect the sound.  

 ## Serial_Port_Comm_LDR_STM  
 Using a software such as CoolTerm or TeraTerm to display the output form a STM32 ARM board.
